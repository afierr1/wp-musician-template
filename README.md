## About

This began as a personal project to learn WordPress development. The purpose of this project was to learn the basics of WordPress development and to potentially gain a career in PHP development. This template is free for anyone to use and customize, but I simply ask that you give me some credit! :) This is a work in-progress and it is currently being used by some professional musicians.

## Why WordPress?
WordPress allows a user to customize a website without having to learn HTML/CSS/Javascript. It is excellent for clients who want to maintain a website without the need of hiring a web developer to constaintly maintain the site. WordPress is also a very popular CMS. Large sites such as the New Yorker and Variety use WordPress.
